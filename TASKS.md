## 1. [P1] Verify server and viewer functionality
Files: server.js, public/index.html, public/js/viewer.js
Run comprehensive health check to ensure HTTP server responds correctly on port 3000 and web viewer loads properly with current canvas state. Test API endpoints and chunk loading.

## 2. [P2] Enhance mobile viewer experience
Files: public/css/style.css, public/js/viewer.js, public/index.html
Improve touch controls, responsive design, and mobile navigation in CSS and JavaScript for better mobile device support. Focus on touch-based pan/zoom interactions.

## 3. [P3] Optimize chunk loading performance
Files: public/js/viewer.js
Implement viewport culling, lazy loading, or rendering improvements in viewer.js for smoother canvas exploration with large datasets. Consider caching strategies.

## 4. [P4] Note: Vast empty canvas regions available
Files: painters/
Large unpainted areas exist across most coordinate ranges: north (y:0-1500), west (x:0-1500), south (y:3000-5000), and east (x:3500-5000) regions await artistic exploration.

## 5. [P5] Extend painting library capabilities
Files: painters/lib.js
Add new drawing functions, improve existing ones, or add utility features to the Canvas class in lib.js for enhanced agent capabilities. Consider pattern fills or advanced shapes.
